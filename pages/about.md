# About me
Man. Where do I even start?
My name's Kaylynn. She/her. Lots of people call me Kay, or just "k". Whatever floats your boat - I'm not too fussed!
I'd say I'm a part-time programmer, but it eats up my thoughts 24/7.
I don't really have any sweeping qualifications, or.. anything like that. Take my word for it, yeah?

## Interests & hobbies
- cats cats cats cats cats cats i love cats
- Compilers!
- Functional programming, category theory, type systems.
- Haskell, SML, OCaml. I'll learn these eventually
- Low-level and systems programming.
- Music! I love music. Please please please send me music! I listen to a lot.
- Digital art and 3D modelling - I hop into blender every so often.

## Languages, technologies and other indecencies

- Rust. I guess this probably isn't too much of a surprise!
- Python. I still come back to it every so often.
- Unity & C#. I love gamedev and I still have an itch for it.
- Parsers. I have consumed the eldritch knowledge required to write and understand them.

I have little bits of experience with lots of other languages and toolkits, but these are what I'm confident in
or familiar with. This part isn't all too flattering, and I wish I was better at lots of these.
But oh well! Only so much I can be good at.
