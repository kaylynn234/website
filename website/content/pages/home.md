# Welcome!
Hey there! I'm Kaylynn, a programmer/hobbyist/nerd generalist from Australia.

## Places to go

This website is where pretty much all of my internet-ing happens, and there are a few things worth mentioning:

- [The obligatory "about me" page](/about).
- [Assorted ramblings from yours truly](/blog).

There are also a couple less "proper" bits and pieces strewn about this site. These are mostly things I did for friends
or myself, so don't think too hard about them!

- [Convert between microwave cooking times](/arewemicrowaveyet). I got tired of doing the math in my head.
- [A rudimentary Hearthstone deck tracker](/decktracker). I originally made this for a friend who didn't have access to
  HDT while they were away from home.

If none of those are real interesting, here's some photos of my cat:

Her name is Nicky and I love her very much.
