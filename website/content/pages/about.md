# About me
I'm Kaylynn (she/her) - lots of people call me Kay, or just "k", but Kaylie works too. I'm really not too fussed -
whatever floats your boat!

I'm a software engineer from Australia, and like many other "good at computer" people I just want to run away from the
creeping silicon panopticon of modern society to live on my own in the woods with eight cats. Teaching sand to think was
a mistake.

Other than that, I spend my spare time talking to friends, playing games that I'm bad at, and listening to music. I also
use my spare time to take an ungodly amount of photos of my cat because she is cute and I love her. I do some writing
occasionally too, and most of that ends up here on my blog.

## Find me
- on [GitHub](https://github.com/kaylynn234). I don't publish repositories here often.
- on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/KaylynnMorgan2). This is where most of my ramblings go.
- via [Email](mailto:mkaylynn7@gmail.com). I'm very bad at checking this.
- on Discord at `Kaylynn#0001`. Just send a friend request. I don't bite!

## Interests & hobbies
- cats cats cats cats cats cats i love cats
- Functional programming, category theory, type systems.
- Compilers, low-level and systems programming.
- Music! I love music. Please please please send me music! I listen to a bunch of stuff, so don't worry about genre.
- Digital art and 3D modelling. I hop into blender every so often.
- Mahjong. I'm not the best at it, but I enjoy it a lot! The client I use is
  [MahjongSoul](https://mahjongsoul.yo-star.com/), and my UID is `122978798`. If you wanna play sometime, feel free to
  get in touch!

## Languages, technologies and other indecencies
- Rust. It's what I use for this site!
- Python. My first programming language, and one that I still have a soft spot for.
- Unity & C#. I love gamedev and I still have an itch for it. C# sucks though.
- Formal grammars and parsers. A while ago I decided that I wanted to write a parser generator, and I haven't been the
  same since.

This isn't an exhaustive list - I have experience with *lots* of other tools and languages - but I'm the most familiar
with these.
