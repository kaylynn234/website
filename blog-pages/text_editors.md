Text editors. Text editors. Text editors.  
I could probably also title this "why is everything terrible". Oh well.

I think text editors are a bit like laptops, or mobile phones, in the regard that literally all of them *suck* in one
way or another. Visual Studio Code is an accursed Electron app, and can be pretty slow - as I write this now I'm
noticing the typing latency and it's getting to me. But christ the highlighting is good. I never realised how much I
relied on its semantic highlighting until I tried to switch to another editor. And Sublime Text. I truly wish I could
just love sublime text and be done with all of this, but ohohoho - things aren't ever that simple. Unfortunately,
Sublime's new licensing scheme is kinda bleh, and its highlighting sucks in comparison to VSC. It also has a couple of
UI oddities that frustrate me a bit. It *is* fast and very lightweight though. So that's a plus.

And then there is JetBrains. Their editors are a bit slow, and they're resource hogs. They also have some pretty
cumbersome UI/UX decisions - neverending dialogs and whitespace you have no control over. It seems they go a bit hard on
the "magic formatting" side of things. And for some reason this company has an IDE for every language in existence,
except Rust, because fuck you apparently? And on top of this, they'll set you back a pretty decent sum of money - a sum
that I personally would rather spend on something nicer, like a night out or maybe some other fun thing.

And oh boy. None of these editors run in a terminal, and I'm almost at the point where I do everything in my terminal.
I'm also probably not too far away from using a tiling WM, which is a bit depressing to admit. In terms of terminal
editors, there are.. a couple. There's `nano`, `vim`, and of course `emacs`. Unfortunately my brain is too small for
`vim`, so that's a no-go. I haven't really found `nano` expandable enough for my uses, so unless I'm missing something
it's also a no-go. And then there's `emacs`. I don't know if I could learn how to use `emacs` and stay sane. I should
probably give it an honest go sometime, but I'm tired and.. I dunno.

I really just want something that doesn't suck that I can use in my terminal. I would really appreciate nice
highlighting too. So I thought I might want to try and homebrew something myself, but that's a lot of work. I figure I
might get to that later. I have some other decently big projects I'm working on at the moment, and I don't want to get
too sidetracked. Too many things to do means I wind up doing none of them.

Anyway. This was a short little post. I have a longer one in the works but I keep getting sidetracked. Stay on the
lookout for that, I guess. It's late once again, so I probably oughta go to sleep.

Night night.
